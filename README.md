<h1>pdf_highlighting</h1>

Automatically highlights the names in PDF by comparing it with the employee names in Excel Sheet.

<b>Steps to make it work on your PC:</b>

Download all the files and the codes in the same directory.
Install pymuPDF // this is used to do operations on pdf such as reading, searching and Highlighting 
Install pandas // this is for taking data from the Excel and storing data in the form of list

<b>Work Flow:</b>
Stp 1) The names ae stored in the form of a list
Step 2) The algorithm takes each element in the list one by one and finds it page by page in the PDF
Step 3) Once it finds the required letter in PDF it gets highlighted
Step 4) After all the names are found and highlighted the programe saves it as "output.pdf"

<b>Future Vision:</b>
I want to make it more user friendly and interactive and make it work with various other formats other than excel.
ie. i want to have a GUI Implementation
